-SCSS modules(BEM)

# What I would improve

-Image display: Fetched images are different (mostly vertical and horizontal), so compromises had to be made to balance between the need for pixel-perfect design and finding a solution for displaying images accurately despite them being in different ratios. There's still room for improvement, though.

-Testing: More extended unit testing is needed for components and pages.

-Accessibility: There is still plenty to do, such as tabbing throughout all photos.

-Performance: According to Google's Lighthouse, the mobile performance of this website is quite poor compared to the desktop version. Adjustments can be made concerning the number and quality of images fetched for the mobile version.
