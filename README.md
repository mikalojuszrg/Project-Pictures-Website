# Technologies used

-React

-TypeScript

-SCSS modules(BEM)

# What I would improve

-Image display (fetched images are different (vertical and horizontal), so I had to make compromises to balance the need for pixel-perfect design and find a solution for displaying images accurately despite them being in different ratios. There's still room for improvement, though)

-Testing (more extended unit testing needed for components and pages)

-Accessibility (still plenty to do, such as tabbing throughout all photos)
