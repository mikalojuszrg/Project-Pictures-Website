# Technologies used

-React

-TypeScript

-SCSS modules(BEM)

# What I would improve

-Image display (fetched images are different (vertical (most of them) and horizontal), so I had to make compromises to balance between the need for pixel-perfect design and finding a solution for displaying images accurately despite them being in different ratios. There's still room for improvement, though)

-Testing (more extended unit testing needed for components and pages)

-Accessibility (still plenty to do, such as tabbing throughout all photos)

-Performance (according to Google's Lighthouse, the mobile performance for this website is quite poor compared to the desktop version. Adjustmetns can be done concercing the amount of images fetched for the mobile, also the quality of the images)
